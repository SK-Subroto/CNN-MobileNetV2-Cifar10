# CNN-MobileNetV2-Cifar10
This repository contains the implementation of MobileNetV2 network architecture on CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras &amp; Tensorflow in Python. Using this model, I have achieved 91% training accuracy and 86% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.

In Convolutional Neural Networks, the MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers. The network architecture can be found using this link - https://towardsdatascience.com/mobilenetv2-inverted-residuals-and-linear-bottlenecks-8a4362f4ffd5

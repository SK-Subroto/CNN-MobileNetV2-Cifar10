# CNN-MobileNetV2-Cifar10
This repository contains the implementation of MobileNetV2 network architecture on CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras &amp; Tensorflow in Python.

Using this model, I have achieved 91% training accuracy and 86% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.

In Convolutional Neural Networks, the MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers.
